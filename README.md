# Weather Widget

This project was created using Vite (npm create vite@latest) using a React Typescript template. 

## Project setup
First clone the repo locally and then run `npm install` in the root folder to install all dependencies.

To run the project, use the command: `npm run dev`.

You will require an API key for OpenWeather.co.uk to use the project. You can get one by signing up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). Once you have an API key, you must create a file called `.env`. You can then add your key into this file as shown in the `.env.example` file in the project root. 

### Notes
- Where possible, I have chosen to approach this task in a way that would show the most technical skill using Edozo frontend stack. In terms of what's appropriate I believe this includes: React, Typescript, React Context, Vite, ViteTest (Vitest), React Testing Library, Styled Components and Github.

### Libraries Used:
- styled-components (for styling)
- framer-motion (for animations)
- vitest (for testing)
- react-testing-library (for testing)
- @types/node (for environment variables, in this case the openweather api key)
